Choosing a modern JavaScript UI framework, Pokemon-style.

## Usage

This is a hacked-together fork of [FullScreenShenanigans/ChooseYourFramework](https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans/ChooseYourFramework), which is itself very old code on a hacked-together custom game engine and not production ready.
No guarantees any of this stuff works.

Also, performance is terrible because this is uploading a hacked-together developer build to production.
Eventually [EightBittr](https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans/EightBittr) will have production build supports.
